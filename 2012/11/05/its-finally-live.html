<p>I have, for a while, been aiming to get a personal blog setup. My main driver being that I would like to document some of the thoughts and projects that I take part in.</p>

<p>The <a href='/about/'>about page</a> has a somewhat more business oriented introduction to myself; however this is primarily a hobby project.</p>

<p>I wanted to use this post to not only describe this website but also to describe the structure/design of the site.</p>
<h2>design</h2>
<p>I wanted to make a clean website, one design I really loved was that of <a href='http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rmm/'>Richard Mortier</a>. The original design of that website was done by <a href='http://mark.reid.name/'>Mark Reid</a> whom has kindly allowed anyone to use the design, thanks! Anyway, being me I wanted to put a bit of my own mark, for better or worse.</p>

<p>This design is the result of the butchering of Mark&#8217;s design, while not nearly as good, it certainly feels like my own so I am content. Things to do in this area is to clean up the CSS (its very ugly right now!), to adjust/tweak CSS for posts.</p>
<h2>Jekyll</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that this website is powered by Jekyll, it seems it is almost a ritual to perform an explanation of what Jekyll is however this is 2012 and Jekyll is probably not as edgy/cool as it once was on the web. Nevertheless for those that don&#8217;t know, Jekyll is a cool Ruby program which looks at a directory with a certain structure and content, converting it into static (that&#8217;s standard old-school) html.</p>

<p>Hopefully you can imagine the many benefits of serving static pages and why I decided to go down this route.</p>

<p>I will write more about Jekyll as I learn more tricks and continue to improve this blog.</p>

<p>For now though, I will leave it like this :).</p>

<p>P.S. If the rest of the site seems barren it is because it is designed to adapt to lack of content (which is currently the case right now).</p>
