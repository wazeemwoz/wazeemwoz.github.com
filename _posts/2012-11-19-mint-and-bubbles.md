summary: Got rid of windows and switched to Mint 13, heres what I think of it so far.
---

First things first, I have nothing against windows. There are a multitude of apps and features that I find very useful (not forgetting all the games!) as part of my computing needs.

However with attempts to automate the deployment of this site using Rake I found some of the command line of windows very frustrating. Although I was content with using git-bash/cygwin I couldn't find an easy way to force rake system to use cygwin or git-bash. In the end I got tired of trying to push a square into a triangle and decided to return to unix-like environment.

I have predominately used Debian based distro's (arch being the exception here) and they have served me well. I wasn't in a very experimental mood and hence decided to try out Mint 13, main reason being as my previous Linux workstation was Mint 11 and I was happy with it.

I have the x64 with Cinnamon and what can I say? I am thoroughly impressed! Things work out of the box and this is a first for me with... actually with any OS. Troubleshoot maybe the wifi driver? The sound? the mouse input? NO. It just works, and it works very well.

While very impressed I am hardly surprised, this is because over the years my installations have been getting smoother and easier, maybe this might be down to growing experience with GNU/Linux but I think there is more at play here. It is of course the exceeding efforts of the OSS community, so hats off to them.

I still have some annoyances, my main gripe is that Chrome unlike in Windows does not place its tabs in the window bar, I take it this might be because of Cinnamon as this worked in Mint 11.

Graphics software still seem lacking, I admit this is just my inability to adjust but Gimp just confuses me and feels non-intuitive to use. If you know a good alternative to Gimp please feel free to point it out.

Maybe I ought to just write my own graphics tool? Maybe just maybe....
