I have, for a while, been aiming to get a personal blog setup. My main driver being that I would like to document some of the thoughts and projects that I take part in.

The <a href="/about/">about page</a> has a somewhat more business oriented introduction to myself; however this is primarily a hobby project.

I wanted to use this post to not only describe this website but also to describe the structure/design of the site.

<h2>design</h2>

I wanted to make a clean website, one design I really loved was that of <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rmm/">Richard Mortier</a>. The original design of that website was done by <a href="http://mark.reid.name/">Mark Reid</a> whom has kindly allowed anyone to use the design, thanks! Anyway, being me I wanted to put a bit of my own mark, for better or worse.

This design is the result of the butchering of Mark's design, while not nearly as good, it certainly feels like my own so I am content. Things to do in this area is to clean up the CSS (its very ugly right now!), to adjust/tweak CSS for posts.

<h2>Jekyll</h2>

You may have noticed that this website is powered by Jekyll, it seems it is almost a ritual to perform an explanation of what Jekyll is however this is 2012 and Jekyll is probably not as edgy/cool as it once was on the web. Nevertheless for those that don't know, Jekyll is a cool Ruby program which looks at a directory with a certain structure and content, converting it into static (that's standard old-school) html.

Hopefully you can imagine the many benefits of serving static pages and why I decided to go down this route.

I will write more about Jekyll as I learn more tricks and continue to improve this blog.

For now though, I will leave it like this :).

P.S. If the rest of the site seems barren it is because it is designed to adapt to lack of content (which is currently the case right now).
