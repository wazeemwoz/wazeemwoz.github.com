  <p>
    The names Waseem Suleman and currently I work as a Technical Analyst in the Healthcare IT industry currently working for Cerner Corporation (more about this role below).
  </p>
  <p>
    Work keeps me very busy however somehow I still manage to find time to freelance. I have a keen interest in developing Games, Web applications, Android applications and Operating systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of computers my other passion is in design. I feel design is the essense of problem solving in the real world, whether this be website design or a shirt design. One of the aims of my blog portion of this website is to showcase some of my art pieces/designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    At heart I am an entrepreneur and eager to get involved in projects; if you feel you have a project I may be interested in, feel free to contact me.

                    No, that is not a typo or mistake, I completed the MSci degree at University of Nottingham. For those that dont know MSci is a fairly recent degree offered by a number of English Universities where the related Master and Bachelor courses are integrated to make a single 4 year course. In reality this just breaks down to doing the traditional 3 years of the BSc and then followed by the usual extra one year for the MSc.
